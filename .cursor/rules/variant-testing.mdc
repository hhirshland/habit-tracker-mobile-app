# Variant Testing Workflow

## When to Apply

When the user asks to create "variants," "alternatives," "versions," "AB test," "comparison," or "design exploration" of a component or page section. Default to **3 variants** unless the user specifies otherwise.

## Instructions

### Before Building

1. If the user provides design directions for each variant, follow them.
2. If the user does **not** specify directions, propose 3 distinct design strategies before writing code (e.g., minimal/clean, social-proof-heavy, interactive/gamified). Wait for confirmation or adjustment before proceeding.
3. For each variant, state a one-line **design thesis** explaining its core idea.

### Generating Variants

- Create separate files named `{ComponentName}VariantA.tsx`, `{ComponentName}VariantB.tsx`, `{ComponentName}VariantC.tsx` in the same directory as the original component (or a `variants/` subdirectory if preferred).
- Every variant **must** export a component that accepts the exact same props interface as the original, so they are drop-in replaceable.
- Each variant should take a **meaningfully different** approach — not just tweaked spacing, colors, or minor copy changes. Aim for distinct layout, interaction pattern, information hierarchy, or user flow.
- If the original component doesn't exist yet, define a shared props interface in a separate `{ComponentName}.types.ts` file and import it in each variant.

### Variant Switcher

- Always generate a `{ComponentName}VariantSwitcher.tsx` wrapper component alongside the variants.
- The switcher should:
  - Accept the same props as the variants and forward them.
  - Render a **floating toggle bar** (positioned at the bottom or top of the component, visually distinct, high z-index) with buttons labeled A / B / C to switch between variants in real time.
  - Display which variant is currently active (e.g., "Viewing: Variant A").
  - Default to Variant A on mount.
- The toggle must be easy to remove later — a single component swap back to the chosen variant.

### Quality Standards

- Maintain the project's existing design system (colors, fonts, spacing, component library).
- Every variant must be **fully functional** — no placeholder buttons or stubbed interactions.
- Every variant must be **fully responsive** across mobile screen sizes.
- Include meaningfully different copy/headlines where applicable, not just layout changes.
- Preserve all original functionality and data flow.

### Output Format

After generating the variants, provide:

1. A **table summarizing key differences** across the variants (layout, interaction model, copy strategy, unique elements).
2. Guidance on how to swap the `VariantSwitcher` into the existing app to start testing.
3. Instructions for removing the switcher once a winner is chosen.
