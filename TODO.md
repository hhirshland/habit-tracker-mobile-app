## Features
- [ ] Progress tab -- track your progress over time including habit completion rates, as well as progress in other relevant metrics (like weight, fitness PRs, etc).  Goal is to visualize and track how the habits drive results that matter to you

- [ ] Integrate with apple health data
- [ ] Reminders
- [ ] Weekly reviews (& notification)
- [ ] Logo


## Bugs
- [ ] 

## Improvements
- [ ] Make the streak relate to how many days in a row you have logged a habit (triggered the event) not how many days have a habit filled out.  This should be similar, but basically if you backlog a bunch of habits that shouldn't increase your streak.
- [ ] Add event tracking with Posthog.  Create a rule to define how to implement event tracking.
- [ ] Dark mode

## Ideas
- [ ] shortcuts for doing things like pushing to github, eas / app store
- [ ] learn how to do OTA updates
- [ ] Integrate with whoop data?
- [ ] Journal feature (with AI)
- [ ] AI habit recommendations 
- [ ] Turn on paid subscriptions
- [ ] Google / Apple / Passkey Auth
