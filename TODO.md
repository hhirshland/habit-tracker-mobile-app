# TODO

## Features
- [ ] Progress tab -- track your progress over time including habit completion rates, as well as progress in other relevant metrics (like weight, fitness PRs, etc).  Goal is to visualize and track how the habits drive results that matter to you
- [ ] Identity statements -- add in identity statements, and tie habits to identity statements.  This should help users stick with their habits.

## Bugs
- [ ] 

## Improvements
- [ ] Make the streak relate to how many days in a row you have logged a habit (triggered the event) not how many days have a habit filled out.  This should be similar, but basically if you backlog a bunch of habits that shouldn't increase your streak.
- [ ] Add event tracking with Posthog.  Create a rule to define how to implement event tracking.

## Ideas
